# About the Project

This project is a part of the **ALX Airbnb Database Module**, where you will implement advanced SQL querying and optimization techniques to work with a simulated Airbnb database. By diving into real-world challenges like optimizing query performance, writing complex SQL scripts, and applying indexing and partitioning, participants will gain hands-on experience with database management and performance tuning. This ensures you are equipped to handle large-scale applications where efficiency and scalability are critical.

## Requirements
To successfully complete this project, learners must:
    * Have a solid understanding of SQL fundamentals, including SELECT, WHERE, and GROUP BY clauses.
    * Be familiar with relational database concepts such as primary keys, foreign keys, and normalization.
    * Have basic knowledge of performance monitoring tools (`EXPLAIN, ANALYZE`).
